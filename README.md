# Surface-Pro-Screen-Flicker-Solver
Easy fix for Surface pro screen flickering issue

How does it work:
- My Surface Pro 4 begun having a screen flickering issue, it would flicker and stop flickering randomly but consistently, every 10 seconds or so, sometimes less sometimes more. I noticed that if im watching a video that it does NOT flicker. That is how I came to a theory that it only flickers when the screen is still. Meaning that, if anything AT ALL was moving on the screen, including you scrolling through youtube or doing anything at all, as long as everything was not still, it would not flicker. If you experience flickering behave this way on your surface as well, then this program will deal with it. I arrived to a conclusion that to solve this issue I just need to have something move on the screen all the time and not be annoying. So how do we do that? The Tray icons on taskbar. I crated a program that will change its icon's color from white to yellowish and keep switching back and forth, that way there will always be movement on the screen, as taskbar is always visible on windows.

How to use properly:
1. Download as .zip
2. Press WINDOWS+R and type: shell:startup (this will open your startup folder. Any program in this folder will start when windows starts)
3. Extract all the files from the .zip in a folder anywhere, and select the Surface Pro Solver.exe>Right click>Create Shortcut
4. Drag and drop the shortcut you created into the startup folder
5. Run the Surface Pro Flicker Solver.exe file (it will automatically go to your tray)
6. Make sure to drag it out of the box where all tray icons are to the ones that are always shown, if you drag it there it will stay there always.
